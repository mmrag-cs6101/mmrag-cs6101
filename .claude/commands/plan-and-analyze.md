I'll help you create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) through systematic requirements gathering. Let me engage the product-requirements-analyst agent to guide you through this process.

Use the Task tool with the product-requirements-analyst agent to conduct a thorough requirements gathering session for: $ARGUMENTS

The agent will systematically work through:
1. **Initial Discovery** - Understanding the high-level vision and problem
2. **Goal Definition** - Defining business objectives and success metrics
3. **Requirements Gathering** - Functional and non-functional requirements
4. **Scope Definition** - What's included/excluded and constraints
5. **Research and Validation** - Competitive analysis and risk assessment

Once the requirements gathering is complete, the agent will generate a comprehensive PRD and save it to `docs/prd.md`.

The final PRD will include:
- Executive Summary
- Problem Statement and Opportunity
- Goals and Success Metrics
- User Personas and Use Cases
- Functional & Non-Functional Requirements
- Scope and Constraints
- Technical Considerations
- Timeline and Milestones
- Risks and Mitigation
- Appendices (research, competitive analysis)

This systematic approach ensures we capture all critical requirements before moving to implementation.
