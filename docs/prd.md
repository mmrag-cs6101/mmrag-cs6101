### Business Opportunity
Successfully reproducing MRAG-Bench results will:
- Validate the effectiveness of open-source models for medical multimodal RAG
- Establish a reusable framework for future medical AI research
- Demonstrate feasibility of high-performance multimodal systems on consumer hardware
- Create foundation for advancing medical image understanding capabilities

### Market Context
